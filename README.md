### Datasets Used:
Police Incident Blotter: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
This data set shows police data that has been verified by protocol standards. It was used as Mason's primary data set.

2020 Census Data: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/2020-census-redistricting-data-extracts
This data set gives population data based on the 2020 census. It was used in conjunction with the Police Incident Blotter to determine incidents per capita.

Cell Towers: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-cell-tower-points1
This data set detailed all of the cell towers within Allegheny Country, as well as their locations. It was used as Nick's primary data set.

Munincipalities: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-municipal-boundaries1
This data set shows munincipalities in Allegheny County. It was used to pinpoint the exact neighborhoods using the locations in the Cell Tower data set.

Playground: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds
This data set shows both the names of playgrounds in the City of Pittsburgh and their respective neighborhoods. It was used as Caroline's sole data set (since neighborhood information was given here, no extra dataset was needed.)
